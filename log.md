### Day 2: Februrary 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working a project at work(feeling guilty writing this, I know I have code for 1 hour apart from work😥). In addition, started to practice HTML and CSS by making a portfolio website through youtube(HTML is Done).

**Thoughts**: I am feeling guilty that I didn't code on my own today, but atleast I did start working on portfolio. So, I am happy about it.
